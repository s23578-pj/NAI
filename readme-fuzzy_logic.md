# Fuzzy Logic

Fuzzy logic is a many-valued logic system where variable truth values can range between 0 and 1, allowing for the representation of partial truth between complete true and complete false. In contrast, Boolean logic restricts variable truth values to integers 0 or 1.

Your will find in file main.py section `CHECK EMPLOYEE'S CASH ALLOWANCE SECTION` with three variables to be filled with inputs like:

`position experience` - How many years of experience on current position has an employee, on a scale of 0 to 10?
_Fuzzy set: poor, average, good_

`seniority in company` - How many years have the employee worked in our company, on a scale of 0 to 10?
_Fuzzy set: poor, average, good_

`efficiency` - How many tasks has been done (per month), on a scale of 0 to 120?
_Fuzzy set: poor, mediocre, average, decent, good_

### Output

`cash allowance` - How much should we appreciate our employee, how high should be cash allowance, on a scale of 0% to 50%?
