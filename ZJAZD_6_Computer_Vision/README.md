## Program purpose

This program is used for hand gestures detection in real time including major packages: Hand Gesture Recognizer using
the MediaPipe framework and Tensorflow in OpenCV and Python. In this application we will detect:
okay, peace, thumbs up, thumbs down, call me, stop, rock, live long, fist and smile.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites and Installation

Before run program install necessary Python packages:
About version make sure you have at least
1. Python – 3.x (we used Python 3.8.8 in this project)
2. OpenCV – 4.5

Run “pip install opencv-python” to install OpenCV.
3. MediaPipe – 0.8.5

Run “pip install mediapipe” to install MediaPipe.
4. Tensorflow – 2.5.0

Run “pip install tensorflow” to install the tensorflow module.
5. Numpy – 1.19.3

If you are working on MAC just use pip3 command.

### How to run the program
Run just every .py file with script per project and used method or press the run button.

### Gestures manual

"stop" or "live long" -> music: stop  
"okay": -> music: pause  
"smile" -> music: unpause
