```
### How To Play

Run the game by executing the hexapawn.py script.
You will be prompted to choose a player (Player 1 or Player 2).
Depending on your choice, the game will start, and you can make your moves.
The game will continue until one player wins or there are no legal moves left.
After the game ends, you will see the winner and the number of rounds played.
