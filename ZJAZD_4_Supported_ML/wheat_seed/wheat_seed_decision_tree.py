Decision trees serve as a widely adopted supervised learning technique in machine learning, applicable to both
classification and regression tasks. They structure data into a tree-like format, where internal nodes signify
distinct features, each branch represents a decision based on those features, and each leaf node encapsulates
a final outcome or prediction. The essence lies in recursively dividing the dataset along features,
strategically selecting the most informative ones at each step to optimize the uniformity of resulting subsets.

In this specific context, we delve into the examination of wheat seed data, classified into three distinct categories.
The training and testing phases utilize 80% and 20% of the dataset, respectively. The decision tree's maximum
depth is set to 8. Subsequent to training the algorithm and evaluating its performance on the testing data,
precision metrics provide valuable insights.

Please ensure that your data is stored in a txt file ('wheat_seed.txt')
